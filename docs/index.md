![Akka Persistence Postgres]({{ 'assets/project-logo.png' | absolute_url }})

The Akka Persistence Postgres plugin allows for using Postgres database as backend for [Akka Persistence](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence.html) and [Akka Persistence Query](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-query.html).

akka-persistence-postgres writes journal and snapshot entries to a configured PostgreSQL store. It implements the full akka-persistence-query API and is therefore very useful for implementing DDD-style application models using Akka and Scala for creating reactive applications.

Itâ€™s been originally created as a fork of [Akka Persistence JDBC plugin](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-jdbc) 4.0.0, focused on PostgreSQL features such as partitions, arrays, BRIN indexes and others. Many parts of this doc have been adopted from the original [project page](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/4.0.0/index.html).

The main goal is to keep index size and memory consumption on a moderate level while being able to cope with an increasing data volume.

## Installation

To use `akka-persistence-postgres` in your SBT project, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.swisborg" %% "akka-persistence-postgres" % "0.5.0-M9"
```

For a maven project add:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.swisborg</groupId>
    <artifactId>akka-persistence-postgres_2.13</artifactId>
    <version>0.5.0-M9</version>
</dependency>
```
to your `pom.xml`.

> :warning: Since Akka [does not allow mixed versions](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/common/binary-compatibility-rules.html#mixed-versioning-is-not-allowed) in a project, Akka dependencies are marked a `Provided`. This means that your application `libraryDependencies` needs to directly include Akka as a dependency. The minimal supported Akka version is 2.6.16.
